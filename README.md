Short description
This repository contains the group project website built for the Web Development POE (2025). The site is a responsive, accessible, and media-rich front-end project created with HTML, CSS and JavaScript to present a proposed website for The Haven Night Shelter — a non-profit organisation serving homeless adults in Cape Town and surrounding areas.

Organisation overview
The Haven Night Shelter is a registered non-profit organisation in South Africa that provides temporary shelter and support to homeless adults. With multiple shelters across Cape Town and surrounding areas, the organisation focuses on physical care, social services, personal development and family reunification to support clients in transitioning from street life to stable homes.

Website description — The Haven Night Shelter
The site is a contemporary, flexible platform designed to inform, engage and convert visitors into supporters (donors and volunteers). Key goals:
- Explain the organisation’s mission, services and locations clearly.
- Accept donations (including recurring “Buy-a-Bed” sponsorships).
- Provide a volunteer gateway and enquiry forms for community involvement.
- Demonstrate transparency and impact using an interactive shelter map, an impact dashboard and story-driven content.
- Use responsive, accessible layouts so the site is usable on mobile, tablet and desktop.
